**erick-solares/erick-solares** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


- things I enjoy outside of data: 
- taking my dog to the dog park, going to a dog friendly venue and I am one of the rarest one that enjoy running!
- camping and stargazing is one of my favorite things to do.
