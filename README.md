## Hi there 👋 I am Erick, a Junior Data Analyst passionate about turning data into actionable insights.  
📊 Skilled in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python — with projects in business dashboards, data cleaning, and visualization.  
🔍 Transitioning from the service industry and eager to apply my experienced into Data Analysis. Always learning, always exploring data. Let’s connect!

- things I enjoy outside of data: 
- taking my dog to the dog park, going to a dog friendly venue and I am one of the rarest one that enjoy running!
- camping and stargazing is one of my favorite things to do.
